# TheBookNook
Book Nook is a community-driven online platform where readers connect, discuss, and share their love for books. Built using Java (Spring Boot) with SQLite (managed via DB Browser for SQLite), it lets users explore book collections, post reviews, rate reads, and participate in lively discussion groups.
